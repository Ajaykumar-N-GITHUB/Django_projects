    <h1>📘 Read Me - Farm Management System</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>After submitting an audio file, please allow a few seconds for processing, as the AI works internally to analyze and save the data.</li>
      <li>A <strong>login alert</strong> will be sent for every successful login.</li>
      <li>Workers can take their own time to record audio. Recording will continue until they <strong>manually press the stop button</strong>.</li>
      <li>Owners are encouraged to <strong>use the application for a few days</strong> to get familiar with its features and train their workers accordingly.</li>
      <li>💡 For best results, ensure a <strong>stable internet connection</strong> when uploading audio or generating reports.</li>
      <li>If a worker’s audio submission results in an error, they should <strong>try rephrasing the message in a different way with the same meaning</strong>.</li>
      <li>Only one type of entry can be submitted at a time — either an <strong>investment</strong> or a <strong>harvest</strong>, but not both together.</li>
      <li>While recording audio, make sure to clearly mention the <strong>item name</strong>, the activity type <strong>(buy or sold)</strong>, and the <strong>amount.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>✨ Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>👨‍🌾 Separate dashboards are available for <strong>owners, managers, and workers</strong> for a user-friendly experience.</li>
      <li>🎙️ Workers can record short voice messages (Tamil/English) to log <strong>investment or harvest details</strong> via the left-side panel.</li>
      <li>📝 Workers can submit detailed daily work reports (Hindi/Tamil/English) through the right-side panel.</li>
      <li>✅ Worker submissions will first appear in the <strong>manager’s dashboard</strong>. Only after manager approval will they be displayed in the <strong>owner’s dashboard</strong>.</li>
      <li>🔍 Managers can review and approve/reject worker submissions from their dashboard.</li>
      <li>👨‍🌾 Owners can edit or remove the entries once records are approved by managers.</li>
      <li>📋 Owners can view the complete <strong>list of managers and workers</strong> by clicking the <strong>Manage</strong> button in the top-right corner of the dashboard.</li>
      <li>➕➖ Owners can <strong>add or remove workers</strong> from the owner dashboard.</li>
      <li>📊 Owners can download <strong>expense reports</strong> on a monthly or yearly basis.</li>
      <li>📑 Owners can download <strong>worker log reports</strong> for a day, week, month, or year.</li>
      <li>⏰ Owners can <strong>set reminders</strong> for important farm activities.</li>
      <li>✏️ Owners can <strong>edit or remove incorrect investment/harvest entries</strong> made by workers.</li>
      <li>📱 Since this is a web app, there may be minor <strong>UI mismatches on mobile devices</strong> (actively being improved).</li>
